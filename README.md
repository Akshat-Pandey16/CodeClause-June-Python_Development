# Task 1 - URL Shortener
Description : Use of the Cuttly API is present. To create a new account and use the API, follow these simple steps. After creating an account, I went to "My Account" and clicked on "Edit Account," where I was able to view account details and click on a button to get a new API key (so I can make API requests). To complete, just replace api key with API key(code) and the URL; want to shorten.

# Task 2 - Alarm Clock with GUI
Description : The alarm project's goal is to use Python to implement an alarm clock. Python has a number of innovative libraries, including datetime and tkinter, that enable me to build projects that use the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface for setting alarms in 24-hour format.

# Task 3 - Voice Assistant
Description : To create this voice assistant for performing various tasks like accessing files from the device, opening a browser, finding the time, the weather, etc., I used a number of Python modules. The speech recognition module, which is at the centre of the entire project, is one of the main modules. With the help of this, Assistant can hear voice messages, decode them, and also produce vocal outputs.

# Task 4 - Python Flappy Bird Game
Description : I have used Pygame, a cross-platform collection of Python modules made specifically for creating video games. It includes sound and graphics libraries made specifically for use with the Python programming language.
